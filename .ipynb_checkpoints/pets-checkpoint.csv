My name is Padfoot and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by an Animal Control Officer on November 1, 2024. I was surrendered by my previous owner because they had too many cats.<p/><p/>I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home once I get to know you.<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home. When I go to my new home it is important to be patient with me and allow me time to acclimate to my new environment at my own speed. It is best to keep me in a smaller, quiet room, with my food, bed, and litterbox until I am comfortable and confident enough to start exploring the rest of my home.<p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>I am currently at an offsite location looking for my forever family! <p/><p/>Adoptions at partner stores are coordinated on a ""first-come, first-served"" basis. It is recommended that you call the offsite location before going to the store in case the animal is in the process of being adopted or already adopted. Delays on the profile being removed from the website after adoption is to be expected. <p/><p/>",

My name is Bowzer! I came to RASKC as a stray and now I'm looking for a new home! <p/><p/>I'm a big, silly pup who is looking for his next adventure! I have a great, outgoing personality that makes everyone want to meet me. I can be a bit jumpy when I first meet a new person, but I settle down nicely if the people around me stay relaxed. Once I've settled into a good position for head pats and belly rubs, I won't leave your side. <p/><p/>Since being at RASKC, the awesome volunteers have been hard at work teaching me some leash skills. I can be a bit bouncy to begin with because I'm happy to go outside but I walk nicely once we get going. My new family should be ready to teach me all about being a good boy. I've also been going to playgroup and making new friends during my stay in the shelter! I do best with dogs who are the same size, or bigger. I can be an exuberant player so a friend who likes to wrestle would be ideal. <p/><p/>I weigh 74lbs and am considered a large breed dog. <p/><p/>I would do best in a home without small children. <p/><p/>I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",

We are also highly food motivated and have been caught multiple times biting through food bags! At our foster home we did a good job of coexisting with the senior cats, outside of stealing their food at times!<p/><p/>Of the two of us, I`m shyer and more sensitive. I may back away if directly petted, but you can often find me snuggling with your leg when you aren`t looking! And oftentimes when faced with a new situation, I wait for my sister to show it`s okay before I join in too. I can be very affectionate when it`s on my own terms, and I like to meow when I want attention. I also have an inquisitive curiosity as I love to find tiny bugs to watch! When our foster dad was using his standing desk, we would often grab onto his leg as we wanted him to sit down with us! I`m also known to give love-bites and play a bit rough with hands, but I mean well and will stop if you give me a lil `owie!`<p/>.<p/>We would probably like a quieter home as we still are shy around most people and new situations. I would like to be adopted with my sister Torta so we can continue to play and snuggle together!<p/><p/>Hi, my name is Spatlo!<p/>I was living at a foster home with my sister Torta since we were both scared of humans, but we eventually learned how nice humans can be! <p/>Both me and my sibling are high energy kitties who love chasing each other and playing with toys (especially wands!).

If you are considering adding a second bunny to your family, familiarize yourself with the rabbit bonding process and don't hesitate to reach out if you would like us to host a speed date to find the best match.  <p/><p/>I am looking for someone who can provide me with plenty of love and attention. <p/><p/>When it comes to feeding me, I will need the proper balance of pellets, timothy hay, fresh vegetables and access to a fresh water! <p/><p/>For housing, I will need appropriate room to roam, with separate spaces for a hidey house, litter box, play area and food and water. I am not meant to live in a cage all the time, so be sure you can provide me with time outside my enclosure at least once a day to stretch my legs, explore and exercise. Just be sure to bunny proof the space! Cleaning my cage and grooming are important for me too! <p/><p/>I am a gentle soul who likes to take things slow.<p/>",

I was adopted and returned on October 26, 2024 due to my adopter working out of town a lot and I displayed some separation anxiety.<p/><p/>I'm a shy lady here in the shelter and prefer people who go slowly with me. Once I'm sure of you, I turn into a playful, wiggly, silly pup. I haven't met any other dogs while at RASKC so it's unknown how I do with them. It's always a good idea for resident dogs to meet me in the shelter first so the staff can help us get off on the right paw! <p/><p/>I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",

At the shelter I know how to ""sit"", ""stay"", ""come"", ""down"" and ""shake"". I am a very smart dog that likes so show my stuff.<p/><p/>I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home! After I get all of my zoomies out first though.<p/><p/>I am an independent dog who likes to do my own thing! When I want to go do something, my mind is set and that is the task that I am set on.<p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p/>",

After much TLC from the wonderful vet staff and my caregivers I am on the road to recovery!<p/><p/>Although my past is unknown it is clear I have had some human interaction in my past life. I am quiet and keep to myself, but if you approach me slowly and offer me chin scritches I will happy lean in to them :)<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home. When I go to my new home it is important to be patient with me and allow me time to acclimate to my new environment at my own speed. It is best to keep me in a smaller, quiet room, with my food, bed, and litterbox until I am comfortable and confident enough to start exploring the rest of my home.<p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/>",

I am not meant to live in a cage all the time, so be sure you can provide me with time outside my enclosure at least once a day to stretch my legs, explore and exercise. Just be sure to bunny proof the space! Cleaning my cage and grooming are important for me too! <p/><p/>I am a gentle soul who likes to take things slow.<p/>",

We are not meant to live in a cage all the time, so be sure you can provide us with time outside my enclosure at least once a day to stretch my legs, explore and exercise. Just be sure to bunny proof the space! Cleaning our cage and grooming are important for us too! <p/><p/>We are gentle souls who like to take things slow.<p/><p/>We are currently with a foster - Please submit an adoption interest form and our foster will be in touch with you!<p/>",

My prior owners were seniors. They brought me to the shelter when they were no longer able to care for me and said that I was outgoing, loving, playful, and a true Prince.<p/><p/>I was a bit chonky when I first came to the shelter on April 14, but now I am at a much healthier weight at around 69 pounds. I do love my food and will happily do (almost) anything you ask for a treat!<p/><p/>I may be a senior dog, but I still have plenty of get up and go for adventures or play sessions! If you take me for a walk or let me enjoy a good chew toy, I am happy to hang out while you work or binge watch your favorite show. I prefer to do my snoozing on a comfy dog bed, couch, or on your bed with you!<p/><p/>At my foster home, I like to look out the window and watch what is going on and if a dog goes by, I will bark and whine because I am excited to see them. I do not really like to see cats or squirrels so I will let them know that. I need a home with no cats or small animals.<p/><p/>My prior owners said I was dog-reactive. I am showing some reactivity in my foster home, but when I was at the shelter, I participated in play groups with other dogs my size and seemed to really enjoy it! My foster caregiver tries to take me on walks early in the morning when there are less dogs out and about. I am working on seeing dogs without reacting. Sometimes I can do it, other times it is harder for me. Hopefully my forever home will continue to work on this with me as I love my walks!<p/><p/>My foster caregiver thinks I would enjoy a home where my people are home more often than not as I really like spending time with people. I do not have to be by your side all the time, but I like to know you are there with me. I have been learning it is okay to stay by myself. At first, I whined and barked, but I am much quieter and relaxed now that I am learning my people will come back and also have access to the couch to snooze on while I am alone. I am a bit of a couch potato!<p/><p/>My foster caregiver says I am the perfect mix of chill and silliness. She tells me I am such a sweet boy and hopes that I will find a forever home soon!<p/>",

When I go to my new home it is important to be patient with me and allow me time to acclimate to my new environment at my own speed. It is best to keep me in a smaller, quiet room, with my food, bed, and litterbox until I am comfortable and confident enough to start exploring the rest of my home.<p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>You can visit me at the Pet Adoption Center on weekdays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm, Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm. <p/><p/>The Pet Adoption Center is located at 21615 64th Ave S, Kent, WA 98032.<p/><p/>Come and visit me today, I'd love to go home with you!<p/>",

I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p/>",

If you and your family are ready to fall in love my awesome self, please check me out!!<p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!

I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",

My name is Boogie. I came to RASKC as a stray and now I'm looking for my new home! <p/><p/>I'm a BIG puppy! I'm very sweet but a bit on the shy side at first. I may not have had much socialization in the past so new experiences are kind of scary right now. I'm sure with some TLC and a nice, loving family I can grow to be as confident as I am big! Right now my favorite thing to do is try to get in my favorite staff members' laps, even though I clearly don't fit. I'll make it work! <p/><p/>I am 80lbs at only nine months old so my new family should be prepared for me to be a very large adult dog. <p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>",

I can get overstimulated with petting, so please move carefully with me and keep an eye out for signs that I might need a break.<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home.

When I was a wee little one, I was not taught how nice and friendly people can be, but I am learning quickly! Though I may be timid at first, once you take the time to show me I can trust you I will show you just how wonderful I can be.<p/><p/>I would do best in a home with teens and adults who can respect my space as I will respect theirs.<p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow.

My name is Kendall and I'm a rabbit who is looking for a forever home. <p/><p/>I was brought in by animal control on 10/22. <p/><p/>I could potentially be bonded to a new rabbit friend with proper introductions. If you are considering adding a second bunny to your family, familiarize yourself with the rabbit bonding process and don't hesitate to reach out if you would like us to host a speed date to find the best match.  <p/><p/>I am looking for someone who can provide me with plenty of love and attention. <p/><p/>When it comes to feeding me, I will need the proper balance of pellets, timothy hay, fresh vegetables and access to a fresh water! <p/><p/>For housing, I will need appropriate room to roam, with separate spaces for a hidey house, litter box, play area and food and water. I am not meant to live in a cage all the time, so be sure you can provide me with time outside my enclosure at least once a day to stretch my legs, explore and exercise. Just be sure to bunny proof the space! Cleaning my cage and grooming are important for me too! <p/><p/>I am a gentle soul who likes to take things slow.<p/>",

This is what my current foster parents have to say about me:<p/><p/>Hi, my name is Torta!<p/>I was living at a foster home with my brother Spatlo since we were both scared of humans, but we eventually learned how nice humans can be! <p/>Both me and my sibling are high energy kitties who love chasing each other and playing with toys (especially wands!). We are also highly food motivated and have been caught multiple times biting through food bags! At our foster home we did a good job of coexisting with the senior cats, outside of stealing their food at times!<p/><p/>Of the two of us, I`m the more courageous and cleverer kitty,I`m easy to handle and pick up! When I first met the older cats, my foster dad would often have to hold me back to ensure I didn`t scare them. I also have a reputation as a troublemaker as I`m the one who finds food bags and starts breaking into them! But I`m also a purry kitty who loves head scritches and lying on a warm lap! When our foster dad was using his standing desk, we would often grab onto his leg as we wanted him to sit down with us!<p/><p/>We would probably like a quieter home as we still are shy around most people and new situations. I would like to be adopted with my brother Spatlo so we can continue to play and snuggle together!<p/>",

I am engaging and need a handler who needs me just as much as I need them. I am goofy, fun-loving, typical husky.<p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home with older children.<p/>",

She is friendly with other dogs, although smaller dogs may find her too rambunctious.  She does need a special diet for her allergies, and takes a daily medication.  She hopes to find a family who will buy her some fashionable pajamas and a nice raincoat - Rosie is a fair-weather girl!  She does cry when she's left alone so I don't think she'd be a good candidate for apartment living.""<p/><p/><p/>",

We are not meant to live in a cage all the time, so be sure you can provide us with time outside my enclosure at least once a day to stretch my legs, explore and exercise. Just be sure to bunny proof the space! Cleaning our cage and grooming are important for us too! <p/><p/>We are gentle souls who like to take things slow.<p/><p/>We are currently with a foster - Please submit an adoption interest form and our foster parent will be in touch with you!<p/>",

My name is Karma and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by an Animal Control Officer on June 6, 2024 after I was abandoned in a park. I was adopted and returned on September 21, 2024 because I had some pretty bad separation anxiety. My previous adopter states that I did great with men, women, children and large dogs, but not a fan of small dogs or cats. They described me as active, very sweet and cuddly. My only fault is my separation anxiety, so I am looking for family that will work with me on that :)<p/><p/>I weigh 55.0 lbs and am considered a ""large breed"" dog.<p/><p/>I must admit I was really shut down when I first arrived at RASKC. I am starting to realize that the people here are really nice, but I am still very stressed. I am really looking forward to going to a new home where it's cozy and quiet. <p/><p/>My caregivers mention that I walk well on leash and potty-trained for the most part!<p/><p/>I have been out to doggy playgroup and overall did well! Ask the staff about my playgroup experience. <p/><p/>I am an adaptable dog who loves to go with the flow! I am outgoing and carefree, and I just can't wait to find my forever home!<p/>",
