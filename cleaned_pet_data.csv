It is best to keep me in a smaller, quiet room, with my food, bed, and litterbox until I am comfortable and confident enough to start exploring the rest of my home.<p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>I am currently at an offsite location looking for my forever family! <p/><p/>Adoptions at partner stores are coordinated on a ""first-come, first-served"" basis. It is recommended that you call the offsite location before going to the store in case the animal is in the process of being adopted or already adopted.

We are also highly food motivated and have been caught multiple times biting through food bags! At our foster home we did a good job of coexisting with the senior cats, outside of stealing their food at times!<p/><p/>Of the two of us, I`m shyer and more sensitive. I may back away if directly petted, but you can often find me snuggling with your leg when you aren`t looking! And oftentimes when faced with a new situation, I wait for my sister to show it`s okay before I join in too. I can be very affectionate when it`s on my own terms, and I like to meow when I want attention. I also have an inquisitive curiosity as I love to find tiny bugs to watch! When our foster dad was using his standing desk, we would often grab onto his leg as we wanted him to sit down with us! I`m also known to give love-bites and play a bit rough with hands, but I mean well and will stop if you give me a lil `owie!`<p/>.<p/>We would probably like a quieter home as we still are shy around most people and new situations. I would like to be adopted with my sister Torta so we can continue to play and snuggle together!<p/><p/>Hi, my name is Spatlo!<p/>I was living at a foster home with my sister Torta since we were both scared of humans, but we eventually learned how nice humans can be! <p/>Both me and my sibling are high energy kitties who love chasing each other and playing with toys (especially wands!).

My prior owners were seniors. They brought me to the shelter when they were no longer able to care for me and said that I was outgoing, loving, playful, and a true Prince.<p/><p/>I was a bit chonky when I first came to the shelter on April 14, but now I am at a much healthier weight at around 69 pounds. I do love my food and will happily do (almost) anything you ask for a treat!<p/><p/>I may be a senior dog, but I still have plenty of get up and go for adventures or play sessions! If you take me for a walk or let me enjoy a good chew toy, I am happy to hang out while you work or binge watch your favorite show. I prefer to do my snoozing on a comfy dog bed, couch, or on your bed with you!<p/><p/>At my foster home, I like to look out the window and watch what is going on and if a dog goes by, I will bark and whine because I am excited to see them. I do not really like to see cats or squirrels so I will let them know that. I need a home with no cats or small animals.<p/><p/>My prior owners said I was dog-reactive. I am showing some reactivity in my foster home, but when I was at the shelter, I participated in play groups with other dogs my size and seemed to really enjoy it! My foster caregiver tries to take me on walks early in the morning when there are less dogs out and about. I am working on seeing dogs without reacting. Sometimes I can do it, other times it is harder for me. Hopefully my forever home will continue to work on this with me as I love my walks!<p/><p/>My foster caregiver thinks I would enjoy a home where my people are home more often than not as I really like spending time with people. I do not have to be by your side all the time, but I like to know you are there with me. I have been learning it is okay to stay by myself. At first, I whined and barked, but I am much quieter and relaxed now that I am learning my people will come back and also have access to the couch to snooze on while I am alone. I am a bit of a couch potato!<p/><p/>My foster caregiver says I am the perfect mix of chill and silliness.

I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>You can visit me at the Pet Adoption Center on weekdays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm, Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm. <p/><p/>The Pet Adoption Center is located at 21615 64th Ave S, Kent, WA 98032.<p/><p/>Come and visit me today, I'd love to go home with you!<p/>",black neutered male domestic shorthair cat pet adoption center kent batman available adoptioni good samaritan october affectionate lovebug thrilled cuddle home youbecause shy nature best calm quiet home home important patient allow acclimate environment speed best smaller quiet room food bed litterbox comfortable confident exploring rest homei gentle loving cat things slow nervous situations looking family understands warm devoted friendyou visit pet adoption center weekdays saturdays sundays pet adoption center located kent visit today love home

It is best to keep me in a smaller, quiet room, with my food, bed, and litterbox until I am comfortable and confident enough to start exploring the rest of my home.<p/><p/>I am a sweet Cat who may need extra time and attention to warm up to new situations and new people. When I was a wee little one, I was not taught how nice and friendly people can be, but I am learning quickly! Though I may be timid at first, once you take the time to show me I can trust you I will show you just how wonderful I can be.<p/><p/>I would do best in a home with teens and adults who can respect my space as I will respect theirs.<p/><p/>I am a gentle and loving cat who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might need some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>You can visit me at the Pet Adoption Center on weekdays from 12:00 pm to 5:00 pm, Saturdays and Sundays from 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm. <p/><p/>The Pet Adoption Center is located at 21615 64th Ave S, Kent, WA 98032.<p/><p/>Come and visit me today, I'd love to go home with you!<p/>",black spayed female domestic shorthair cat pet adoption center kent zeze available adoptioni animal control officer november sti independent kitty thing gift attentioni getting attention terms overstimulated petting eye signs breakbecause shy nature best calm quiet home home important patient allow acclimate environment speed best smaller quiet room food bed litterbox comfortable confident exploring rest homei sweet cat extra attention warm situations people wee little one taught nice friendly people learning quickly though timid first trust wonderful bei best home teens adults respect space respect theirsi gentle loving cat things slow nervous situations looking family understands warm devoted friendyou visit pet adoption center weekdays saturdays sundays pet adoption center located kent visit today love home

We are also highly food motivated and have been caught multiple times biting through food bags! At our foster home we did a good job of coexisting with the senior cats, outside of stealing their food at times!<p/><p/>Of the two of us, I`m the more courageous and cleverer kitty,I`m easy to handle and pick up! When I first met the older cats, my foster dad would often have to hold me back to ensure I didn`t scare them. I also have a reputation as a troublemaker as I`m the one who finds food bags and starts breaking into them! But I`m also a purry kitty who loves head scritches and lying on a warm lap! When our foster dad was using his standing desk, we would often grab onto his leg as we wanted him to sit down with us!<p/><p/>We would probably like a quieter home as we still are shy around most people and new situations. I would like to be adopted with my brother Spatlo so we can continue to play and snuggle together!<p/>",tortie spayed female domestic shorthair cat raskc foster home tortaim foster home current foster parents say mehi tortai living foster home brother spatlo scared humans learned nice humans sibling high energy kitties love chasing playing toys wands highly food motivated caught multiple times biting food bags foster home good job coexisting senior cats outside stealing food timesof two courageous cleverer kittyim easy handle first met older cats foster dad hold back ensure didnt scare reputation troublemaker one finds food bags starts breaking purry kitty loves head scritches lying warm lap foster dad using standing desk grab onto leg wanted sit uswe probably quieter home shy people situations adopted brother spatlo continue play snuggle together

My name is Karma and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by an Animal Control Officer on June 6, 2024 after I was abandoned in a park. I was adopted and returned on September 21, 2024 because I had some pretty bad separation anxiety. My previous adopter states that I did great with men, women, children and large dogs, but not a fan of small dogs or cats. They described me as active, very sweet and cuddly. My only fault is my separation anxiety, so I am looking for family that will work with me on that :)<p/><p/>I weigh 55.0 lbs and am considered a ""large breed"" dog.<p/><p/>I must admit I was really shut down when I first arrived at RASKC. I am starting to realize that the people here are really nice, but I am still very stressed. I am really looking forward to going to a new home where it's cozy and quiet. <p/><p/>My caregivers mention that I walk well on leash and potty-trained for the most part!<p/><p/>I have been out to doggy playgroup and overall did well! Ask the staff about my playgroup experience. <p/><p/>I am an adaptable dog who loves to go with the flow!
